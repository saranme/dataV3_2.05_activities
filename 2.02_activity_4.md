#### Simple queries

1. Get the biggest and the smallest transaction with non-zero values in the database (use the `trans` table in the `bank` database).
2. Get account information with an extra column year showing the opening year as 'YY'. Eg., 1995 will show as 95. **Hint**: Look at the first two characters of the string date in the account table.
